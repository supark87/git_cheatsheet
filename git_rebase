#destructive 

- history linear (single parent for each commit)
- rewrites history 
- does not keep entire history of all commits

1. Checkout feature branch 
`git chkeckout feature1`

2. Rebase feature branch on top of the base branch
`git rebase master`

3. checkout base branch
`git checkout master`

4. Merge feature branch into the base branch. Fast forward merge will be used
`git merge feature1`


## Advanced : rebase with squashing -> Makes several commits on one branch as one commit

- You can choose when you merge from pull request

```
